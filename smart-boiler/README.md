The challenge:
- To be able to turn on and off the water heater from the mobile phone
- To be able to turn on and off the water heater on a schedule basis
- The water heater should turn on and off at different times in different days

The solution:
- By using the LittleBits Arduino, Wireless Transmitter, Wireless Receiver, Servo Motor and the LittleBits Led bits, to build 2 circuits: one that is connected to a computer (with the Arduino bit 
and to the Wireless Transmitter) and is controlled by the computer and controlls a LittleBits servo motor (and a LittleBits LED bit) via the Wireless Receiver.
